/*
Given two strings a and b of equal length, whatâ€™s the longest string (S) that can be constructed such that S is a child to both a and b.

String x is said to be a child of string y if x can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from y

Input format

Two strings a and b with a newline separating them

Constraints

All characters are upper-cased and lie between ascii values 65-90 The maximum length of the strings is 5000

Output format

Length of the string S

Sample Input #0

HARRY
SALLY
Sample Output #0

2
The longest possible subset of characters that is possible by deleting zero or more characters from HARRY and SALLY is AY, whose length is 2.

Sample Input #1

AA
BB
Sample Output #1

0
AA and BB has no characters in common and hence the output 0

Sample Input #2

SHINCHAN
NOHARAAA
Sample Output #2

3
The largest set of characters, in order, between SHINCHAN and NOHARAAA is NHA.

Sample Input #3

ABCDEF
FBDAMN
Sample Output #3

2
BD will be optimal substring.
